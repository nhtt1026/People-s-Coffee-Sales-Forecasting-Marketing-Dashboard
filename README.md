# ABC E-commerce Customer Churn Analysis

## Project Overview

ABC E-commerce is a leading global retailer that has experienced strong growth in recent years. However, rising customer churn has become a key concern, posing risks to long-term revenue and business sustainability.

This project focuses on understanding the drivers of customer churn and building predictive models that support proactive retention strategies. By turning customer data into actionable insights, the analysis aims to help the business reduce churn and strengthen customer loyalty.

## Motivation

Customer acquisition is expensive, and losing existing customers directly impacts recurring revenue and growth. For a large e-commerce business like ABC E-commerce, even a small increase in churn can translate into significant lost revenue over time.

Understanding *why* customers leave – and *which* customers are most at risk – is therefore critical. This project was motivated by the need to:

- Quantify churn across different customer segments  
- Identify behavioral and demographic factors associated with churn  
- Provide a data-driven foundation for targeted retention initiatives  

---

## Objective

The primary objectives of this project are to:

1. **Identify key drivers of customer churn** by analyzing customer demographics, purchase behavior, and engagement patterns.  
2. **Build and evaluate predictive models** that estimate the likelihood of churn at the individual customer level.  
3. **Support proactive retention strategies** by translating model outputs and analytical insights into clear, actionable recommendations.

Ultimately, the goal is to enable ABC E-commerce to move from reactive churn management to a more proactive, data-informed approach.

## Tools & Technologies

The analysis and modeling were conducted using:

- **Tableau**  
  - Data exploration  
  - Interactive dashboards and visualizations  
  - Exploratory analysis of customer behavior and churn patterns  

- **SAS Enterprise Miner**  
  - Data preparation and transformation  
  - Predictive modeling (e.g., classification models for churn)  
  - Model comparison and performance evaluation  

Additional tools (if applicable – update as needed):

- [Add: e.g., Excel / SQL / Python / R, etc.]

## Methodology

The project followed a structured analytics workflow:

1. **Data Understanding**
   - Review of available customer data, including:
     - Demographic attributes  
     - Purchase history and monetary value  
     - Engagement and interaction indicators (e.g., activity, frequency)  
   - Definition of the churn label and analysis period.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Tableau**
   - Construction of dashboards to:
     - Visualize churn rates by segment (e.g., region, customer type, tenure)  
     - Explore relationships between behavior metrics and churn  
   - Identification of initial hypotheses about potential churn drivers.

3. **Data Preparation**
   - Cleaning and transforming raw data for modeling in SAS Enterprise Miner  
   - Handling missing values, outliers, and skewed distributions  
   - Engineering features based on customer behavior and engagement.

4. **Predictive Modeling in SAS Enterprise Miner**
   - Development of churn prediction models (e.g., classification techniques)  
   - Training, validation, and testing using appropriate data splits  
   - Comparison of models based on performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, ROC/AUC, lift).

5. **Model Evaluation & Interpretation**
   - Assessment of model performance on holdout data  
   - Examination of variable importance to understand key churn drivers  
   - Use of scores or probabilities to segment customers by risk level.

6. **Business Insights & Recommendations**
   - Translation of analytical findings into business-friendly insights  
   - Identification of high-risk segments and potential retention levers  
   - Suggestions for how predictive scores could be integrated into marketing or CRM workflows.
